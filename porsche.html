        <h2>Porsche</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> â‚¹500/day</p>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Porsche 911 model series (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelf) is a family of two-door, high performance rear-engine sports cars, introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany.
            </p><p> Now in its eighth generation, all 911s have a rear-mounted flat-six engine, and usually 2+2 seating, except for special 2-seater variants. Originally, 911s had air-cooled engines, and torsion bar suspension, but the 911 has been continuously enhanced, and evolved across generations.</p>
            <p> Though the 911 core concept has remained largely unchanged,[1] water-cooled engines were introduced with the 996 series in 1998,[2][3] and front and rear suspension have been replaced by Porsche-specific MacPherson suspension up front, and independent multi-link rear suspension.</p>
            <p>The 911 has been raced extensively by private and factory teams, in a variety of classes. It is among the most successful competition cars. In the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world championship races including Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. Porsche won the World Championship for Makes in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 with 911-derived models</p>

            <p><strong>Features:</strong>A petrol engine with a displacement of 2981cc or 3996cc, producing 443.87bhp or 517.63bhp of power and a torque of 465nm or 530nm.</p>
            <p>A mileage of 9kmpl and a boot space of 132 litres.</p>
            <p>A ground clearance of 100 mm and a kerb weight of 1380 kg.
            <p> A 4 seater car with adjustable headrests, steering, cruise control, keyless entry, multifunction display, steering wheel, navigation system, digital odometer, paddle shifters, power steering, windows, rain sensing wipers, rear armrest, start/stop button, tachometer, 2 drive modes, climate control, reverse camera.</p>
