        <h2>Land Rover Defender 90X</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹8000/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The Land Rover Defender is an iconic and rugged SUV, known for its off-road capabilities, luxurious interior, and modern tech features, all while retaining its classic, boxy design. The Defender blends cutting-edge technology with decades of off-roading prowess.</p>
        <p> The Land Rover Defender is a versatile and capable vehicle that combines legendary off-road prowess with modern luxury and technology. It's a popular choice for adventurers and those who need a vehicle that can handle diverse driving conditions.The 127-inch (3,226 mm) wheelbase Land Rover One Two Seven, available from 1985, was always marketed with the name rendered numerically. </p>
        <p> This engine finally allowed the Defender to cruise comfortably at high speeds, as well as tow heavy loads speedily on hills while still being economical. In theory, it only replaced the older Diesel Turbo engine in the range, with the other four-cylinder engines (and the V8 petrol engine) still being available.</p>
        <p> The Defender is equipped with a range of advanced features, including a touchscreen infotainment system, premium sound system, and various driver assistance systems.It offers configurable seating options, allowing for flexible cargo and passenger arrangements.Land Rover One Two Sevens were built on a special production line, and all started life as One Ten 4x4 chassis (the model was initially marketed as the One Ten crew cab, before the more logical One Two Seven name was adopted).</p>

        <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> The vehicle offers three engine options: a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder (P300) producing around 296 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, a 3.0-liter supercharged inline-six (P400) with approximately 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, enhanced by mild-hybrid assistance for improved efficiency, and a 5.0-liter supercharged V8 (Defender V8) delivering an impressive 518 horsepower and 461 lb-ft of torque for exceptional power and performance.</p>
        <p> Includes autonomous emergency braking, rollover protection, traction control, and more.Built for durability, the Defender’s structure is designed to protect occupants in the event of a collision.All variants are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, ensuring smooth gear shifts and optimal off-road capability.</p>
        <p> A rugged and recognizable design that pays homage to the Defender's legacy, with squared-off edges and a high ground clearance.Lightweight yet durable construction to help with off-road durability and overall performance.Automatically adapts the vehicle's settings for optimal traction on various surfaces (snow, sand, mud, etc.).</p>
        <p> The vehicle is equipped with Hill Descent Control, which helps maintain a slow, controlled speed when descending steep inclines. It also offers available electronic rear and center locking differentials, providing extra traction when needed. With a ground clearance of up to 11.5 inches thanks to its air suspension, the vehicle is well-equipped to tackle large obstacles on off-road trails.</p>
        <p> Available with a panoramic glass roof, or a more traditional roof design, along with a Safari Roof on the 130 model for added storage capacity and a unique look.Modern LED headlights and taillights with a distinctive design.</p>
