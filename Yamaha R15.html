        <h2>Yamaha R15</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹1200/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>For the first and second iteration, the bike had a 270 mm (11 in) single disc with dual piston calipers in the front and a 220 mm single disc single piston caliper at the rear, both the brake systems being made by Nissin of Japan.The bike has dual headlights like the other bikes of the YZF-R series.</p>
        <p> The YZF-R15 v2.0 had undergone changes as compared to the previous version in the cases of the engine control unit (ECU), swingarm, drivetrain unit, split-seat design, higher seat height, LED taillight, wider tires, larger gear ratio (15/47), longer wheelbase, rear mudguard, and redesigned middle and tail section.</p>
        <p> The Yamaha R15 Version 2.0 was designed primarily for enthusiasts who were looking for a high-performance 150cc motorcycle with sports styling. It has been popular among young riders, especially in markets like India and Southeast Asia, where it's often used both for commuting and spirited riding.</p>
        <p> The R15 V2.0 features a more aggressive and angular design compared to its predecessor, with sharper lines and a more aerodynamic fairing. The front end includes a dual headlamp design, which was a significant update over the single headlamp in the first version. The front suspension was a twin telescopic fork, and the rear is a linked type of single shock suspension. The bike has dual headlights like the other bikes of the YZF-R series.</p>
         
        <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> The engine for the first and second iteration (v2.0) was a 149.5 cc single cylinder four-stroke engine with four valves and a single overhead camshaft. The bore and stroke were 57.0 mm × 58.7 mm (2.24 in × 2.31 in). This engine had a claimed 12.2 kW (16.4 hp) of power at 8,500 rpm and 14.5 N⋅m (10.7 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 7,500 rpm.</p>
         <p>The R15 V2.0 is known for its excellent handling and cornering capabilities, owing to its lightweight chassis and low center of gravity. The top speed is typically around 130-135 km/h, depending on the road and conditions.</p>
         <p>It is powered by a 149cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, 4-stroke, SOHC engine. The engine produces around 17 hp at 8,500 rpm and 15 Nm of torque at 7,500 rpm. The R15 Version 2.0 uses Yamaha's VVA (Variable Valve Actuation) technology, which improves engine performance and efficiency across a wide RPM range. </p>
         <p>The R15 V2.0 features an analog-digital instrument cluster, which provides information such as speed, fuel gauge, trip meter, tachometer, and gear position indicator. It also has a fully faired design, which aids in reducing wind resistance during high-speed riding. </p>
