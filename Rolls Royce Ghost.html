        <h2>Rolls Royce Ghost</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹20000/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The Rolls-Royce Ghost is a full-sized luxury car manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. During development, the Ghost was known as the "RR04". It was designed as a smaller, "more measured, more realistic car" than the Phantom. The Ghost features exceptional sound insulation, with a design focused on creating a whisper-quiet cabin. Triple-layered windows, soundproof doors, and thick carpets all work together to block out the outside world.</p>
        <p> The Ghost has a 129.7-inch (3,290 mm) wheelbase, roof height, bonnet height and track widths all of its own, and the Ghost uses Phantom-style air springs. The car also shares the FlexRay electronic system with its larger stablemate.</p>
        <p> The iconic Rolls-Royce grille is large and imposing, framed by a sleek, angular design. The grille is often lit by LED lights, creating a visually striking effect at night. This signature design feature has been refined to create a flowing line that gives the car a balanced, elegant presence.</p>
        <p> The Rolls-Royce Ghost Black badge is a high performance variant of the Rolls-Royce Ghost Second Generation. It was unveiled in October 2021. It differs from the standard model by appearance due to black colour detailing.</p>
            
        <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> It produces around 563 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque, allowing the vehicle to accelerate from 0-60 mph in just 4.6 seconds (despite its large size and luxury focus). It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h).</p>
        <p> Though designed primarily for comfort, the Ghost can reach a top speed of around 155 mph (250 km/h), ensuring that it never feels lacking in power. An 8-speed automatic transmission that provides smooth, imperceptible gear shifts.The car has a kerb weight of 5,445 lb (2,470 kg).[12] The Ghost's platform in turn is used for the Wraith grand tourer and Dawn convertible.</p>
        <p> Whether fully or part-polished, 22-inch nine-spoke wheels are a contemporary and timeless statement.The all-wheel steering, all-wheel drivetrain is powered by the 6.75-litre twin-turbocharged V12, delivering maximum torque from just 1,600rpm. </p>
        <p> This car has a top speed of 155 miles per hour (249 km/h) and can drive 1⁄4 mile (0.40 km) in 12.7 seconds. The bumpers were also subtly revised, while the side character line Rolls-Royce calls a "waft line" was slanted further forward. New alloy wheel and colour options were also offered. </p>
