        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹500/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The BMW M4 Competition is a high-performance sports coupe that blends cutting-edge technology, dynamic handling, and bold design. 
            It’s part of BMW's M Series and serves as a more powerful, track-focused version of the regular BMW 4 Series.

            <p>The M4 features Active Sound, live amplification of the engine's natural sound inducted into the passenger cabin via speakers in the car. BMW claims this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine.

                <p>It is powered by a 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline-six engine producing 503 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque, allowing it to accelerate from 0-60 mph in around 3.8 seconds.</p>
                <p>High Performance M TwinPower Turbo inline 6-cylinder engine<br>
