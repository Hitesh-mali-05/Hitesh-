        <h2>Koenigsegg Agera</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹8000/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg. It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR.The Agera RS variant became the world's fastest production car in 2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of 458 km/h (285 mph).</p>
        <p> The Agera comes with forged aluminum wheels with centre locking nuts, measuring 19-inch on the front and 20-inch on the rear and wrapped in a set of Michelin Super Sport tyres that can be used for speeds of up to 420 km/h (260 mph).</p>
        <p> Koenigsegg made the production car speed record with an Agera RS recording an average speed of 447.2 km/h (277.9 mph). The car achieved a speed of 457 km/h (284 mph) during its northbound run and 436 km/h (271 mph) during its southbound (return run)</p>
        <p> The Agera R can produce lateral cornering forces of 1.60 G, due to a combination of mechanical balance and high levels of grip from the specially developed Michelin Supersport tyres.</p>
        <p> The Koenigsegg Agera RS Phoenix was created as a replacement for the original owner, Manny Khoshbin's crashed Agera RS "Gryphon". The car is finished in fully exposed carbon fibre with 24-carat gold accents adorning the car.</p>

      <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong>The Agera features a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine that produces impressive power figures. Depending on the version, it can produce anywhere from 1,160 to 1,341 horsepower and 1,280 to 1,370 Nm of torque.The Agera RS version set a world record for the fastest production car with a top speed of 277 mph (447 km/h). </p>
      <p> It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 3 seconds and can hit 186 mph (300 km/h) in just 10.9 seconds.The Agera uses a lightweight yet strong carbon fiber monocoque chassis, contributing to its minimal weight while maintaining safety and rigidity.</p>
      <p> It is the first dual-clutch transmission to feature only one input shaft. The second clutch slows down the input shaft during up shifts in order to reduce the time it takes to synchronise the next gear, resulting in faster shift times. Most notably, the transmission weighs only 81 kg (179 lb).</p>
      <p> the Agera R broke six world land speed records for a production car, including 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 14.53 seconds, and 0–300–0 km/h in only 21.19 seconds. </p>
