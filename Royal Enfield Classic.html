        <h2>Royal Enfield Classic</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹2100/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The Royal Enfield Classic motorcycles exude a timeless retro charm. The design is influenced by the brand's early models from the 1950s, blending nostalgic appeal with contemporary styling elements. These motorcycles feature a sculpted fuel tank, round headlamps, analog meters, and leather or premium vinyl seats. </p>
        <p> These engines are tuned for reliability and a smooth cruising experience, delivering a balanced combination of torque and power for both city commuting and highway cruising. The 350cc model offers a smooth ride with ample low-end torque, while the 650cc models (like the Continental GT and Interceptor) provide higher performance and are aimed at more seasoned riders.</p>
        <p> The Royal Enfield Classic offers a relaxed and comfortable riding experience. It’s known for its low seat height, making it accessible for riders of various statures. The twin shock absorbers at the rear ensure a smooth ride over long distances, and the bike's heavier weight provides stability, making it great for cruising.</p>
        <p> The engine uses wet sump lubrication with 15W-50 API SL grade engine oil (JASO MA 2), and fuel is supplied via a UCAL 29 mm constant vacuum carburetor or electronic fuel injection on the dual-channel model. The air cleaner is a paper element, and the engine can be started either electrically or by kick.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> The Royal Enfield Classic maintains its vintage aesthetics while integrating modern features to enhance safety and performance, such as dual-channel ABS for safer braking, Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) for better fuel efficiency and smoother throttle response in newer models, a Tripper Navigation System offering turn-by-turn directions, and improved suspension systems designed to handle rough terrain.</p>
        <p> The Royal Enfield Classic features a 12-volt DC electrical system, powered by a 12-volt, 8 Ah battery. It is equipped with a 12V, H4-60/55W halogen headlamp, a 12V, P21/5W tail lamp, and four 12V, R10W turn signal lamps. The Royal Enfield Classic features a single downtube chassis, with the engine serving as a stressed member. </p>
        <p>  It is equipped with a telescopic front suspension with 35 mm forks and 130 mm of travel, while the rear suspension consists of twin gas-charged shock absorbers with 5-step adjustable preload and 80 mm of travel. The Royal Enfield Classic is powered by a single-cylinder, 4-stroke, twin-spark, air-cooled engine with a displacement of 346cc. It has a bore and stroke of 70 mm × 90 mm and a compression ratio of 8.5:1. The engine produces a maximum power of 19.1 bhp at 5250 rpm and a maximum torque of 28 Nm at 4000 rpm. It features a transistorized coil ignition system, a wet multi-plate clutch, and a 5-speed constant mesh gearbox.</p>
