        <h2>Toyota vellfire</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹4000/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>:  The Toyota Vellfire is a luxurious Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV) known for its spacious interiors, advanced features, and smooth performance. The name "Vellfire" was derived from "velvet" and "fire" to emphasize "smooth" and "passionate" as characteristics of the vehicle. Starting from the AH30 generation, the Vellfire has been given aggressive styling to reflect being the sportier version of the Alphard.</p>
        <p> Toyota showcased a modified version of the AH40 Vellfire, called the Vellfire Spacious Lounge Concept, at the 2023 Japan Mobility Show. It is a 4-seater version of the production Vellfire, with a privacy curtain separating the driver and front passenger from the rear, a mini-fridge, floor trays, new carpeting, folding tables, power outlets and speakers integrated into the seats and headrests respectively, and a coat rack in the trunk. It is painted in a dark grey colour. The Vellfire Spacious Lounge Concept was built by Toyota Auto Body.</p>
        <p> The Spacious Lounge Concept entered production virtually unchanged for 2025, with sales to commence January 31, where it is exclusive to the new Alphard PHEV. It is based on the Executive Lounge and is geared towards chauffeur use.</p>
        <p> The exterior dimensions are kept within 5 m (16 ft) in length and 1.85 m (6.1 ft) in width, to ensure the vehicle conform with the size constraints of standard vertical automated parking systems</p>
        <p> The LM is available in two seating configurations: a 7-seater configuration that is based on the Alphard Executive Lounge variant, and a 4-seater configuration named the "Emperor Suite", based on the Alphard Royal Lounge variant.The Vellfire has been offered since February 2020 as the brand's only import model in the country with the 2.5-litre hybrid engine.</p>           
        <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> The Toyota Vellfire offers a hybrid powertrain, which combines a petrol engine with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions while maintaining strong performance.The minivan can comfortably accommodate 7 or 8 passengers, depending on the configuration, and the seating arrangement allows flexibility.</p>
        <p> Typically, the Vellfire is offered with a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine or a 3.5L V6 engine, with hybrid and non-hybrid variants available. It is a twin model of Toyota Alphard. 3.5-litre petrol 4-wheel drive (Toyota ATC/DTC) - GGH25 (Alphard/Vellfire). </p>
        <p> The Alphard gets slimmer LED headlights and a larger grille up front. Both models can be optioned with sequential blinkers. Also new is an updated V6 engine, the 2GR-FKS that replaces the outgoing 2GR-FE. Output has increased to 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) and 362 N⋅m (267 lbf⋅ft).</p>
        <p> Accelerating from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) can be achieved in 7.5 seconds. The length has grown by 60 mm (2.4 in), the width by 20 mm (0.8 in), and the wheelbase has grown longer by 50 mm (2.0 in); but the height is shorter by 10 mm (0.4 in). The 3.5-litre 2GR-FE V6 along with the 6-speed automatic was carried over from the previous generation.</p>
