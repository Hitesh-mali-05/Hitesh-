        <h2>Bentley Continental GT</h2>
        <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹500/day</p>
        <p><strong><u>Overview</u>:</strong>The Bentley Continental GT is a grand touring car manufactured and marketed by the British company Bentley Motors since 2003. A two-door coupé or convertible and has four seats, it was the first new Bentley released after the company's acquisition by Volkswagen AG in 1998.</p>
             <p> Equipped with advanced suspension systems and all-wheel drive, the GT excels in both comfort and handling, adapting to various road conditions effortlessly.</p>
             <p> The GT’s exterior features wide front intakes, a low-slung profile, and bold wheel arches. The cabin is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, with premium leather upholstery, hand-stitched details, and fine wood veneers.</p>
            <p> The Concept Java never went into production in the form seen in 1994, although 13 cars were made for the Sultan of Brunei. However, the Bentley Continental GT realised the concept of the Java as a more affordable Bentley, manufactured in much larger volumes.</p>
            <p> Retaining the exterior look and the Porsche Panamera platform of the third generation Continental GT, the fourth generation model has been slightly restyled with features adopted from the Bentley Mulliner Bacalar and Mulliner Batur concept cars.</p>

                 <p><strong><u>Features</u>:</strong> A 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine offers a more efficient yet still powerful alternative, producing around 550 horsepower. Provides optimal traction and handling on a variety of surfaces, offering superior performance in both dry and wet conditions.</p>
                         <p>The W12 variant can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 4 seconds.Capable of generating a maximum power of 782 PS (771 bhp) and a maximum torque of 1,000 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft), the new hybrid engine enables the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.2 seconds.</p>
                    <p> This includes the introduction of new headlights, making the model the first Bentley to have a single-headlight setup since the 1959 Bentley S2. At 2,459 kilograms (5,421 lb), the car is also heavier than the third generation model; this owes to the 25.9kWh battery mounted behind the rear axle which contributes to the fourth generation's 49:51 weight distribution.</p>
                    <p> It also has a maximum torque of 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) and a maximum power of 659 PS (650 bhp). The interior features sporty seats and the new Bentley rotating screen. This car also has a convertible edition which has the same capabilities of the GT coupé except the acceleration capability of 0-100 km/h (62 mph) which takes 3.6 seconds.</p>
